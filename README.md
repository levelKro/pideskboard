You can use this files now, but at your own risk. You can report any feedback about this project and execution of this for helping to made a better product.

## Minimum requirements
Please note to use a Fresh new install of the Raspbian OS on your SD card, with SSH enabled, network configured with the hostname, and auto-login to CLI.
After installation, you must not use the device for other thing of project for best performances and security reasons.

* Raspbian OS Lite (not the Desktop, only CLI) (tested with image from december 2020)
* Minimum 4Gb MicroSD card, 8Gb suggested
* Raspberry Pi 0,1,2,3 (tested with Raspberry Pi Zero W)
* Audio output for use with eSPeak (optionnal) (BT for RPi0, BT/HDMI or Analog for RPi1,2,3)
* Video output (HDMI or LCD by GPIO)
* Touch input (for use the player and cameras)
* Raspberry Pi 0,1,2,3 headless ready to use, with SSH enabled and available
* Internet connection

## Raspberry Pi 4
It can be installed on a Raspberry Pi 4, but given the hardware difference and my inability to test it, I can't guarantee the files and guide will work.

## Headless startup
In the "__install\boot" folder you can copy the "ssh" to your MicroSD card "/boot" partition for enabling the SSH.
You can also copy the "wpa_supplicant.conf.dist" into "wpa_supplicant.conf" inside the "/boot" and edit it for activate the Wifi with Raspberry Pi 0 W/WH and Raspberry Pi 3.
